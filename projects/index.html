<h2>On-going Projects</h2>
	<dt><strong><a title="Personal Github Page" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/SarthakJShetty.github.io" target="_blanktype">Personal Github Page</a></strong>
	<dd>
		<li>Building a personal webpage to showcase projects and other information.</li>
		<li>Github page written in HTML for now. Will be integrating new concepts as time progresses.</li>
		<li>CSS and Javascript will be added for additional functionality. Soon.</li>
	</dd>
	</dt>
	<dt><strong><a title="Operation Research" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/ORM" target="_blanktype">Visualization Tools for Operation Research</a></strong></dt>
		<dd>
			<li>Building a tool to visualize the critical point between start and end nodes in a network of activities.</li>
			<li>Currently working towards determining start & stop times in the reverse direction.</li>
			<li>Code is written primarily in Python.</li>
		</dd>
<h2>Completed Projects</h2>
<dl>
	<dt><a title="Differential Drive Donkey Car" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/My-Donkey" target="_blanktype"><strong>Differential Drive Donkey Car</strong></a></dt>
	<dd>
		<li>Build a differential drive Donkey Car, a drivereless small scale vehicle.</li>
		<li>A TensorFlow based Autopilot was trained on nearly 10,000 images of a track.</li>
		<li>The Autopilot was then used to drive the vehicle autonomously. Check it out <a title="DonkeyCar in action" href="https://youtu.be/0Sid7q3nsWY" target="_blanktype">here!</a></li>
	</dd>
	<dt><a title="Robotic Arm" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Arm" target="_blanktype"><strong>4 Degrees of Freedom Gesture Controlled Robotic Arm</strong></a></dt>
	<dd>
		<li>3D printed robotic arm controlled by human gestures through a Microsoft Kinect Sensor.</li>
		<li>Right arm gestures were mimicked by the Arm, whereas left arm was used for orientation.</li>
		<li>The code was written in primarily Arduino and Processing, paired with OpenNI library for collection of skeletal data.</li>
	</dd>
	<dt><a title="Fracture-Detection System" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Fracture-Detection" target="_blanktype"><strong>Fracture-Detection System</strong></a></dt>
	<dd>
		<li>Built a fracture detection system to identify fractures and potential points of fracturing in manufactured components, and accordingly predictions were made for the same.</li>
		<li>The system was based on primarily OpenCV through which fractures were visualized.</li>
		<li>A TensorFlow model, trained on a dataset of normal and fractured gear images was used to make predictions.</li>
	</dd>
	<dt><strong><u> Ultrasonic Based Obstacle Avoider</u></strong>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		<li>Built an Arduino based mobile robot, capable of avoiding obstacles.</li>
		<li>Bot comprised of three ultrasonic sensors oriented in three different directions whicch actively detect obstacles around them.</li>
		<li>The project was a great starting point to learn the basics of Arduino programming.</li>
