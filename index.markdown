I currently work as Computer Vision Engineer at [Path Robotics](https://www.path-robotics.com), developing vision systems that power [autonomous manufacturing robots](https://www.path-robotics.com/robotic-welding-systems/the-robots/af1/).

I graduated from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://cmu.edu) with a Master's in Mechanical Engineering in 2023. At CMU I worked on [robot learning](https://sites.google.com/view/point-cloud-policy/home) and was advised by [Prof. Daniel Seita](https://danielseita.github.io/) and [Prof. David Held](https://davheld.github.io/) in the [Robots Perceiving and Doing Lab](https://r-pad.github.io/), located in the [Robotics Institute](https://ri.cmu.edu).

I was a Research Intern at [Intel Labs](https://www.intel.in/content/www/in/en/research/overview.html), in the Silicon and Systems Prototyping Labs, where I worked on RGB-D and monocular SLAM systems. I developed modules pertaining to pose estimation, sparse map storage and retrieval, trajectory prediction with Kalman Filters, and visual feature extraction.

I was a Research Assistant at the [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in) (IISc), working on [multi-robot](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128202760000236) [path-planning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9622590/), with [Prof. Debasish Ghose](https://aero.iisc.ac.in/people/debasish-ghose/) at the Mobile Robotics Laboratory in the [Aerospace Engineering Department](https://aero.iisc.ac.in/).

I interned at the [Theoretical Ecology and Evolution Laboratory](https://teelabiisc.wordpress.com/) at IISc, advised by [Prof. Vishwesha Guttal](https://teelabiisc.wordpress.com/curriculum-vitae/), where I worked on [multi-robot systems](https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Transient) inspired by ant swarms. I also interned at the [Center for Systems Design](https://csd.nitk.ac.in/) at the [National Institute of Technology - Surathkal](https://nitk.ac.in), advised by [Prof. KV Gangadharan](https://mech.nitk.ac.in/faculty/k-v-gangadharan), where I worked on [small scale autonomous vehicles](https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Donkey), that used imitation learning to steer around a track.

I am currently exploring robot manipulation using dense 3D features and scaling up (pre-)training for robot learning. If you're interested in these questions, [please get in touch](mailto:sjshetty@andrew.cmu.edu)!
