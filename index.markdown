I currently work as Computer Vision Engineer at <a class="links" href="https://www.path-robotics.com">Path Robotics</a>, developing vision systems that power <a class="links" href="https://www.path-robotics.com/robotic-welding-systems/the-robots/af1/">autonomous manufacturing robots</a>.

I graduated from <a title="CMU" href="https://cmu.edu" class="links">Carnegie Mellon University</a> with a Master's in Mechanical Engineering in 2023. At CMU I worked on <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/point-cloud-policy/home" title="ToolFlowNet" class="links">robot learning</a> and was advised by <a title="Prof. Daniel Seita" class="links" href="https://danielseita.github.io/">Prof. Daniel Seita</a> and <a title="Prof. David Held" class="links" href="https://davheld.github.io/">Prof. David Held</a> in the <a title="R-PaD" href="https://r-pad.github.io/" class="links"> Robots Perceiving and Doing Lab</a>, located in the <a title="RI" href="https://ri.cmu.edu" class="links"> Robotics Institute</a>.

I was a Research Intern at <a class="links" href="https://www.intel.in/content/www/in/en/research/overview.html">Intel Labs</a>, in the Silicon and Systems Prototyping Labs, where I worked on RGB-D and monocular SLAM systems. I developed modules pertaining to pose estimation, sparse map storage and retireval, trajectory prediction with Kalman Filters and visual feature extraction.

I was a Research Assistant at the <a class="links" href="https://iisc.ac.in"
            title="Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru">Indian Institute of Science</a> (IISc), working on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128202760000236" title="Elseiver 2020" class="links">multi-robot</a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9622590/" title="IEEE CONECCT2021" class="links">path-planning</a>, with <a href="https://aero.iisc.ac.in/people/debasish-ghose/" title="Prof. Debasish Ghose" class="links">Prof. Debasish Ghose</a> at the Mobile Robotics Laboratory in the <a class="links" href="https://aero.iisc.ac.in/" title="Aerospace Department">Aerospace Engineering Department</a>.

I interned at the <a href="https://teelabiisc.wordpress.com/" title="TEE-Lab" class="links">Theoretical Ecology and Evolution Laboratory</a> at IISc, advised by <a href="https://teelabiisc.wordpress.com/curriculum-vitae/" class="links" title="Prof. Vishwesha Guttal">Prof. Vishwesha Guttal</a>, where I worked on <a href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Transient" title="Multi-Robot Systems" class="links">multi-robot systems</a> inspired by ant swarms. 
        I also interned at the <a href="https://csd.nitk.ac.in/" title="CSD NITK" class="links">Center for Systems Design</a> at the <a href="https://nitk.ac.in" class="links" title="NITK">National Institute of Technology - Surathkal</a>, advised by <a href="https://mech.nitk.ac.in/faculty/k-v-gangadharan" title="Prof. KV Gangadharan" class="links">Prof. KV Gangadharan</a>, where I worked on
        <a title="DonkeyCar" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Donkey" class="links">small scale autonomous vehicles</a>, that used imitation learning to steer around a track.

I am currently exploring robot manipulation using dense 3D features and scaling up (pre-)training for robot learning. If you're interested in these questions, <a class="links" href="mailto:sjshetty@andrew.cmu.edu">please get in touch</a>!
